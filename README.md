It is in the works so be patient! I will upload the whole implementation soon.


So far the setup is something like this:<br>
`SETUP`

`code`: <br>
  `note: Go to stylegan2-ada-pytorch to setup your environment according to that`<br>
  git clone https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2-ada-pytorch.git <br>
  cd stylegan2-ada-pytorch <br>

  pip install dlib torch torchvision torchaudio opencv-python Pillow dlib face-alignment skimage
